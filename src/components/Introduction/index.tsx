            <p className="my-4">Some common examples of best practices in software development include:</p>

            <ol className="my-4">
                <li className="my-4">
                    <strong>Code Quality Standards</strong>: Writing clean, readable, and maintainable code that follows
                    consistent style and structure.
                </li>
                <li className="my-4">
                    <strong>Version Control</strong>: Using version control systems (like Git) to manage code changes
                    and maintain a history of project development.
                </li>
                <li className="my-4">
                    <strong>Automated Testing</strong>: Implementing automated tests (unit, integration, and end-to-end)
                    to catch bugs early and ensure software reliability.
                </li>
                <li className="my-4">
                    <strong>Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)</strong>: Automating code integration
                    and deployment processes to quickly and reliably push updates.
                </li>
                <li className="my-4">
                    <strong>Documentation</strong>: Maintaining comprehensive documentation for code, APIs, and
                    processes to facilitate collaboration and onboarding.
                </li>
                <li className="my-4">
                    <strong>Security Practices</strong>: Implementing security best practices to protect software from
