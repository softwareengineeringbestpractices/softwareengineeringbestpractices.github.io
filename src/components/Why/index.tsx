            <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Why?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li className="py-1"><b>Improved Quality:</b> Best practices help ensure that code is well-structured, reliable,
                    maintainable
                    & efficient. This leads to higher-quality software that performs better and is less prone to bugs
                    and
                    issues.
                </li>
                <li className="py-1"><b>Enhanced Maintainability:</b> Adhering to best practices makes code more understandable and
                    easier to
                    modify. This is important for future maintenance, whether it&apos;s fixing bugs, adding features, or
                    refactoring.
                </li>
                <li className="py-1"><b>Scalability:</b> Proper design and coding practices help ensure that software can handle
                    increased
                    loads and scale effectively as user demands grow.
                </li>
                <li className="py-1"><b>Collaboration:</b> Following established practices makes it easier for teams to collaborate. Code
                    that adheres to common standards is easier for other developers to understand and contribute to.
                </li>
                <li className="py-1"><b>Security & Risk Management:</b> Following best practices helps identify and mitigate potential
                    risks
                    early in the development process, reducing the likelihood of costly issues later on. Best practices
                    include guidelines for writing secure code and protecting against common vulnerabilities, helping to
                    safeguard software from potential threats.
                </li>
                <li className="py-1"><b>Fast Feedback:</b> Following best practices helps optimizing the feedback loop by improving the
                    deployment frequency and reducing the lead time for change. Lead time for changes (LTFC) is the time
                    it
                    takes for a code change to go from being committed to a branch to being deployed in production.
